[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dagcoin/dagcoin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dagcoin/dagcoin)

Dagcoin as cryptocurrency is built on a new technology called DAG chain, offering scalable, low cost and secure payments. Dagcoin uses byteball network as an underlying platform. Our mission is to provide alternative currency for everyday using, focusing on Asian market to help unbanked people manage their funds better. By doing that, Dagcoin will be the most widely used open source cryptocurrency in the world.

## Main Features

TBD

## Installation

Download and install [NW.js v0.14.7 LTS](https://dl.nwjs.io/v0.14.7) and [Node.js v5.12.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v5.12.0/).  These versions are recommended for easiest install but newer versions will work too.  If you already have another version of Node.js installed, you can use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to keep both.

Clone the source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dagcoin/dagcoin.git
cd dagcoin
```

If you are building for testnet, switch to testnet branch:
```sh
git checkout testnet
```

Install [bower](http://bower.io/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)  if you haven't already:

```sh
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Build Dagcoin:

If you are using macOS or Linux run:
```sh
make prepare-dev-tn
```
Then run Dagcoin desktop client:
```sh
/path/to/your/nwjs/nwjs .
```
Otherwise run:
```sh
bower install
npm install
grunt
```
If you are on Windows or using NW.js and Node.js versions other than recommended, see [NW.js instructions about building native modules](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Advanced/Use%20Native%20Node%20Modules/).

After first run, you'll likely encounter runtime error complaining about node_sqlite3.node not being found, copy the file from the neighboring directory to where the program tries to find it, and run again. (e.g. from `dagcoin/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/node-v57-darwin-x64` to `dagcoin/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/node-webkit-v0.26.2-darwin-x64`)

Then run Dagcoin desktop client:

```sh
/path/to/your/nwjs/nwjs .
```

## Build Dagcoin App Bundles

### Android

- Install Android SDK
- Run `make android-debug`

### macOS and Linux

- run `make prepare-package`

### Windows

- `grunt desktop`
- copy `node_modules` into the app bundle ../byteballbuilds/Byteball/win64, except those that are important only for development (karma, grunt, jasmine)
- `grunt inno64`

## About Dagcoin

TBD

## Dagcoin Backups and Recovery

Dagcoin uses a single extended private key for all wallets, BIP44 is used for wallet address derivation.  There is a BIP39 mnemonic for backing up the wallet key, but it is not enough.  Private payments and co-signers of multisig wallets are stored only in the app's data directory, which you have to back up manually:

* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/dagcoin`
* Linux: `~/.config/dagcoin`
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dagcoin`


## Translations

Dagcoin uses standard gettext PO files for translations and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/dagcoin) as the front-end tool for translators. To join our team of translators, please create an account at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) and translate the Dagcoin documentation and application text into your native language.

To download and build using the latest translations from Crowdin, please use the following commands:

```sh
cd i18n
node crowdin_download.js
```

This will download all partial and complete language translations while also cleaning out any untranslated ones.
